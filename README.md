# Process-Scheduling-implementations
Process scheduling in C involves managing the order in which tasks (processes) are executed on a CPU. Algorithms like FCFS, SJF, RR, and priority scheduling dictate when processes run, aiming to optimize resource utilization and system responsiveness by determining which process gets CPU time next.

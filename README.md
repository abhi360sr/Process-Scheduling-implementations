# Process-Scheduling-implementations
Process scheduling in C involves managing the order in which tasks (processes) are executed on a CPU. Algorithms like FCFS, SJF, RR, and priority scheduling dictate when processes run, aiming to optimize resource utilization and system responsiveness by determining which process gets CPU time next.



Process scheduling in C is the practice of determining the sequence in which tasks (processes) are executed on a CPU within an operating system. This sequence is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and system responsiveness. Various scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling, dictate the order in which processes are selected for execution.

- **FCFS**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive, non-preemptively.
- **SJF**: The shortest job (process with the smallest burst time) is executed first, minimizing average waiting time.
- **RR**: Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum), then moves to the end of the queue.
- **Priority Scheduling**: Processes with higher priority (based on criteria like deadlines or importance) are executed first, ensuring critical tasks are handled promptly.

Implementing these algorithms involves data structures like queues or lists to manage the order of processes waiting to use the CPU. Each algorithm has its advantages and is suited for different scenarios, such as maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, or ensuring fairness.

Efficient scheduling contributes to overall system performance by ensuring that the CPU is utilized effectively, reducing idle time, and maintaining a balance between system responsiveness and resource allocation. In C programming, scheduling algorithms are typically simulated using structures, arrays, and functions to manage and execute processes based on the chosen algorithm's rules and priorities.
